# IX Canonical Showcase

The flagship set of demos showing IX composing its 46 MCP tools against four distinct real-world problem classes. Every artifact in this folder was produced by orchestrating IX tools through a language model; none were hand-written by a traditional developer.

This folder serves three purposes:

1. **Marketing** — prove IX can handle real aerospace, cyber, finops, and signal-processing problems.
2. **Onboarding tutorial** — traverse the demos from 3-tool to 13-tool pipelines to learn the IX mental model.
3. **Regression harness** — each demo replays through `ix_pipeline_run` (after R1 lands) and fails CI on any bit-level drift.

See `ix-roadmap-plan-v1.md` for the roadmap that turns this ad-hoc collection into a CI-gated first-class project artifact.

## Reports and investigations

|---|---|---|
| [rapport-bracket-genetique-a350.md](rapport-bracket-genetique-a350.md) | 50-page French technical report v1 | ~21 000 |
| [rapport-bracket-genetique-a350-v2.md](rapport-bracket-genetique-a350-v2.md) | Revised v2: math-normalized for Zed/GitHub, case studies, risk register, MCP JSON-RPC annex, bilingual glossary | ~26 000 |
| [improvement-investigation-ix-v1.md](improvement-investigation-ix-v1.md) | R1-R6 recommendations + R6 adversarial addendum + canonical showcase packaging proposal | ~4 500 |
| [brainstorm-next-horizon-ix.md](brainstorm-next-horizon-ix.md) | R7-R9 next-horizon brainstorm (Autograd, QED-MCP, PyO3+WASM) | ~3 000 |
| [r7-autograd-codex-review.md](r7-autograd-codex-review.md) | Codex + Claude code-first review of R7, merged 5-day schedule | ~2 200 |

## Phase 1 deliverables (R7 Week 1)

The first phase of the R7 Autograd-IX work shipped Days 1-3 of Week 1 plus the full validation pass described in `ix-roadmap-plan-v1.md` §5. Phase 1 artifacts:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [ix-roadmap-plan-v1.md](ix-roadmap-plan-v1.md) | Consolidated R1-R9 + canonical showcase roadmap with dependency graph, phasing, risk register, definition-of-done gates |
| [r7-autograd-codex-review.md](r7-autograd-codex-review.md) | Initial Codex + Claude code-first review that locked in the build-scratch-over-ndarray decision, the `ExecutionMode` enum, and the Hermitian-mirror FFT fix |
| [r7-day2-review.md](r7-day2-review.md) | Four-provider Day 2 multi-LLM review (Codex + Gemini + Mistral Large + Claude) that reordered Day 3 to put cleanup before new ops |
| [r7-phase1-benchmarks.txt](r7-phase1-benchmarks.txt) | `cargo bench` output for 6 benchmarks: add/mul/matmul/variance primitives + full linreg MSE + full Adam step |
| [r7-phase1-security.txt](r7-phase1-security.txt) | `cargo audit` results: ix-autograd dep cone is CLEAN (0 advisories); 1 workspace-level vulnerability + 4 warnings triaged and deferred |
| [r7-phase1-retrospective.md](r7-phase1-retrospective.md) | Week 1 actual vs planned, go/no-go verdict (PASS, 242× speedup), what went better/worse, Phase 2 readiness, Day 4/5 TODO list |

**Phase 1 verdict:** PASS. R7 Week 1 go/no-go criterion met (gradient Adam converges 242× faster than evolutionary baseline, 15/15 finite-diff tests pass at 1e-5 tolerance). Proceed to Day 4 hardening and Day 5 FFT-behind-feature-flag.

## How to reproduce the demos

**Today (manual tool chaining):** each demo was produced by orchestrating `ix_pipeline` (and other MCP tools) through Claude Code. To reproduce, open the demo's `.html` source, read the tool call sequence embedded in the comments, and replay each call with the recorded inputs.

**After R1 ships:** each demo will have a sibling `pipeline.yaml` file. A single MCP call to `ix_pipeline_run` with the YAML spec will reproduce the demo bit-identically. See `ix-roadmap-plan-v1.md` §5 Week 2 for the migration schedule.

## Planned restructure

Per the roadmap §10, this folder will be reorganized as a progressive tutorial:

```
examples/canonical-showcase/
├── README.md
├── 01-cost-anomaly-hunter/     — 3 tools, finops, simplest
├── 02-chaos-detective/         — 4 tools, signal processing
├── 03-cyber-intrusion-triage/  — 12 tools, multi-domain
├── 04-catia-bracket-generative/— 13 tools, aerospace flagship
│   ├── pipeline.yaml
│   ├── dashboard.html
│   ├── bracket-3d.html
│   ├── toolpath-3d.html
│   ├── context-realistic.html

│   └── rapport-v2.md
├── 05-ix-self-improvement/     — the investigation documents
│   ├── improvement-investigation-ix-v1.md
│   ├── brainstorm-next-horizon-ix.md
│   ├── r7-autograd-codex-review.md
│   └── ix-roadmap-plan-v1.md
├── 06-autograd/                — R7 demo (TBD, Phase 1)
├── 07-python-bridge/           — R9a demo (TBD, Phase 3)
└── 08-wasm-playground/         — R9b demo (TBD, Phase 4)
```

The restructure is scheduled for Week 2 alongside the R1 migration so that every demo gets its `pipeline.yaml` at the same time as it gets its directory.

## CI gate (planned)

Starting Week 2, a GitHub Actions job regenerates every demo on every push to `main` and diffs against golden outputs. Drift fails the build. This makes the showcase a load-bearing regression harness — changes to core IX crates must preserve every demo's output or explicitly bless the new output.
